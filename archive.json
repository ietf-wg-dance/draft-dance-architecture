Alternatively, some recursive servers could authenticate in order to gain access to non-content-related special services, such as a higher query rate-limit quota than is publicly available.\r\n\r\nBetween recursive resolvers and caching/forwarding or stub resolvers, authentication can be used to gain access to special services, such as subscription-based malware blocking, or visibility of corporate split-horizon internal zone, or to distinguish between subscribers to different performance tiers.\r\n\r\nIn the ideal implementation, client and server would bidirectionally authenticate, using DANE certificates to bootstrap TLS transport security.",

JOSE defines the x5u field in [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.5](RFC7515), and COSE defines a field of the same name in [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-cose-x509-08#section-2](draft-ietf-cose-x509) which can be used for out-of-band x.509 certificate discovery. By adopting DANE for out-of-band certificate discovery, CBOR and JSON data may be authenticated, even if the originating sending agent not have IP connectivity, provided that the sending agent's certificate is discoverable in DNS and the receiving agent has access to DNS.\r\n```",

As such, my review here is more an attempt to\r\nprovide feedback to the authors. - The approach is interesting but, to my\r\nknowledge, similar attempts to leverage DNS has been proposed earlier (see\r\ne.g., https://hal.science/hal-03798465/ - not sure if this document builds on\r\nthat work) and it could be interesting to compare with earlier proposals and\r\nwhy this one would stand a better chance of succeeding. - As mentioned in the\r\ndocument, requesting a TLS server to perform DNS lookup actions based on an\r\nunauthenticated request seems prone to dDoS attacks, and it would be good if\r\nthe document could describe in some more detail how DANCE-enabled TLS servers\r\ncould protect against this. - The document touches on aspects of lifecycle\r\nmanagement for these certificates (e.g., \"revocation is performed by simply\r\nremoving a DNS record,' or complexities when a device manufacturer no longer\r\nsupports or maintains the DNS entries). Would it make sense to have a fuller\r\ndiscussion around lifecycle management of certificates in the context of DANCE?\r\nI look forward to future revisions of this document.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This is true, however, I'm wondering why this will lead to a problem. It is in the interest of the server to make sure it authenticates its clients correctly (including checking revocation), so it would only be shooting itself in the foot. If the server is actually compromised by an adversary, there are likely bigger issues to worry about.\r\n",
